# [SolidPattern](http://solidpattern.academy/)

Building applications on Ethereum Blockchain introduces some new challenges. The Solidity Contract Pattern is designed to help developers minimize these hurdles and build smart and scalable backends for ecosystem applications. They do not have a logical pattern to wait for applications on the Ethereum Blockchain, so they can be used in the long run. With a clearly defined pattern, we expect a more efficient implementation of decentralized applications on the Ethereum Blockchain.
